%
% Start: Start of sequence, must denote an integer (i.e. be an integer or a
%        variable that is bound to an integer).
%        § "Start" will always be the first element in the sequence unless the
%          sequence is actually empty.
%
% End:   End of sequence, must denote an integer. Alternatively, can be one of:
%
%        inf, infinite, +(inf), +(infinite)   : for +infinity (recommended: -inf )
%        minf, minfinite, -(inf), -(infinite) : for -infinity (recommended: +inf )
%
%        § Unless the sequence is empty or "End" denotes one of the infinities,
%          §§ "End" will be the last item in the sequence if there is a "K", K>=0
%             such that Start + K*Step == End.
%          §§ Otherwise, "End" will not appear in the sequence and the last
%             item will be some "Last", Last == Start + K*Step, with K>=0 and
%             Last+Step > End if Step>0, Last+Step < End if Step<0
%          ...in other words, sequence enumeration fails as soon the next
%          sequence element would overshoot "End".
%
% Step:  Integer step of sequence, must denote an integer.
%        § Must have the correct sign to reach End from Start.
%        § It is allowed for Step == 0, as long as Start == End.
%
% Value: Either
%        § a fresh variable (freshvar) that will be bound to the next element
%        § or denotes an integer which for which the predicate verifies that
%          it belongs to the sequence.
%
% OptionList:
%        § May be a freshvar or the empty list for "default".
%          If a freshvar, it is bound to the empty list.
%        § If atom "throw_if_empty" is a member of the list, empty sequences
%          lead to an exception.
%          In default mode, the empty sequence is accepted and leads to
%          immediate predicate failure.
% ============================================================================
% Notes
%
% - The core of the predicate is straightforward but the preparation is
%   laborious.
% - I try to have the arguments of helper predicates arranged so that the
%   compiler can quickly decide which clause to use. This means tagging the
%   integer arguments (with int/1, pos/1, neg/1) and moving those to the
%   left (SWI Prolog has a description of its indexing approach here:
%   https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=jitindex )
%   Still keeping the now possibly non-situation-improving cuts in (in fact
%   they may be useful to naive interpreters?)
% - I'm completely relying on integer arithmetic to not wrap around or go
%   out of bounds. We have 64-bit arithmetic augmented by GNU Multiprecision
%   library - should be generally a good assumption.
% - Kudos to jburse for noticing that I hadn't checked the bounds in VERIFY
%   mode. Bugged! But thanks to the unit test, fixed with confidence.
% ============================================================================
% Changes
% 2020-05-21: Moved from throwing ISO standard "domain error" to
%             "my error" because the standard "domain error" is badly designed:
%             - doesn't carry information properly
%             - is non-extensible
%             - is geared toward statements about single-variable domains
%             - ...and the toplevel makes assumptions about how to print it.
%             !! Note that this means that the predicate no longer throws
%                ISO standard error(domain_error(_,_),_). This may or may not be
%                acceptable to the caller.
%             !! In Unit test code, we then need to
%                use the "throws" feature instead of the "error" feature to
%                catch the exception.

% PROBLEM: domain_error/2 , the predicate from library(error) to throw an
% ISO Standard "domain error" expects "domain_error(+Type, +Term)"
% As in: "domain_error(integer, 12.4)"
%
% It does not leave any way to add more information because the ISO
% standard exception does not have any place for that.
%
% On the other hand, the ISO "domain_error/2" term is packed inside an
% "error/2" term as first argument. The second argument of the "error/2"
% term is generally unused (except when the exception is generated by
% foreign code), so we might construct the "error/2" term ourselves and
% put additional information into this second argument. We will leave
% the main values of "domain_error/2" blank.
%
% But then "domain_error/2" seems design toward making a statement about
% one variable only, instead of a combination of variables. More badness.
%
% Decision: Throw "my_domain_error" instead of the ISO "domain_error".
% This also gives full printout on the toplevel. If the toplevel catches
% an ISO error, it will format it to ISO assumptions and output will be
% useless.
%
% Call the below with "throw_unconditionally(e01,2,3,0)" on the toplevel
% for example to see what happens.
